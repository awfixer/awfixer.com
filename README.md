# awfixer.com

this is the source code for awfixer.com the official website for AWFixer and Friends

there are a lot of things here, it is a next.js app with the react router and a few other spicy components.

from there it is a mdx/component/block based site. We use components and blocks to maintain brand identity thru the whole site along with taking the load off of our developers

we took inspiration for parts of the site from payloadcms and their website.

the website is hosted on vercel and the api that it will use in the future is hosted on railway.
