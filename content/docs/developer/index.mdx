## API Authentication

AWFixer uses a privacy-preserving authentication system that doesn't require personal information:

```javascript
import { AWFixerAuth } from '@awfixer/sdk';

// Initialize with your app credentials
const auth = new AWFixerAuth({
  appId: 'your-app-id',
  environment: 'production' // or 'development'
});

// Authenticate user (privacy-preserving)
const session = await auth.authenticateUser();
```

## Privacy Guidelines

When developing with AWFixer tools, follow these privacy principles:

### Data Minimization
- Collect only the data you absolutely need
- Delete data when it's no longer necessary
- Use privacy-preserving alternatives when possible

### User Control
- Give users control over their data
- Provide clear opt-out mechanisms
- Make privacy settings discoverable and accessible

### Transparency
- Be clear about what data you collect and why
- Provide accessible privacy policies
- Regular privacy audits and reports

### Security
- Use end-to-end encryption by default
- Implement proper access controls
- Regular security updates and patches

## Use Cases & Examples

### Privacy-First Mobile Apps
Build mobile applications that respect user privacy:

```javascript
// Example: Private analytics
import { AWFixerAnalytics } from '@awfixer/mobile-sdk';

const analytics = new AWFixerAnalytics({
  privacyMode: 'strict', // No personal data collection
  localOnly: true // Data never leaves the device
});

// Track events without compromising privacy
analytics.track('user_action', { action_type: 'button_click' });
```

### Decentralized Web Applications
Create dApps with AWFixer Identity:

```javascript
// Example: Decentralized authentication
import { AWFixerIdentity } from '@awfixer/web-sdk';

const identity = new AWFixerIdentity();

// User controls their own identity
const credential = await identity.createCredential({
  type: 'email_verification',
  selfSovereign: true
});
```

### Privacy-Preserving Analytics
Implement analytics without tracking users:

```javascript
// Example: Aggregate analytics
import { AWFixerAnalytics } from '@awfixer/analytics-sdk';

const analytics = new AWFixerAnalytics({
  aggregationOnly: true, // Only aggregate data
  noUserIdentification: true // No user tracking
});

// Get insights without violating privacy
const insights = await analytics.getInsights('page_views');
```
